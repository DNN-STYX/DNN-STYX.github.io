**STYX** is a general mutation framework to improve the DNN’s robustness under different adversarial attacks. STYX generates new training data by slightly mutating the training data, and then training the DNN based on the new data. STYX ensures the accuracy of the test dataset while improving the model’s adaptability to small perturbations (which improves the robustness of the DNN). We instantiate STYX to image classification DNNs and a set of general pixel-level mutation rules is proposed. We also compared the three different training methods: STYX, traditional training and adversarial training, showing that our method (STYX) is effective. 

The paper work is presented in [**[1]**](https://github.com/DNN-STYX/DNN-STYX.github.io/blob/master/styx-demo.pdf). And the prototype tool STYX is provided in [**[2]**](https://github.com/DNN-STYX/demo).
