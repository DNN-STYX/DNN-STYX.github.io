**STYX** is a general mutation framework to improve the robustness of DNN. The framework is used to improve the DNN’s robustness under different adversarial attacks. We instantiate Styx to image classification DNNs and a set of general pixel-level mutation rules is proposed. We also compared the three different training methods: mutation training, traditional training and adversarial training, showing that our method is effective.
